# Rubik-Solver

The human race has alway been a creature of curiosity solving fuelling innovation and continue to be the fountainhead of man’s progress, all through out history, bright minds has been occupied with the puzzle of solving the cryptic cube known simply as “Rubik”. This relic has been inherit from one generation to the next refusing to be extinct, refusing to be forgotten in the pages of history. Still in this age of social media and information overload, the “Rubik Cube” is still a timeless pastime.

The project for the subject Artificial Intelligence would be to bring the Rubik Cube into the 21st century with an application which would solve the age-old game of the illustrated Rubik Cube through letting the computer computes the best way to solve a Rubik Cube inputted by the user. 

To be able to achieve this one must master the dark art of solving the Rubik Cube first, being able to understand the in and out of the working of such paradox thus gaining the ability to decipher it with maximum efficiency. 

The user would be summon to feed in the puzzle into the machine which would computed the shortest way to solve the puzzle, after that the machine would give the user the step-by-step recipes to solve the Rubik Cube. The program will be written using Python with the support of Prolog and PyQt for the user interface of the program.
